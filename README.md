# Sexual network structure, HIV prevalence, and the evolution of set point viral load

This repository contains the code to reproduce the analysis of set point viral load (SPVL) evolution with varying network structures.  In this model, we investigate the changes to SPVL with four behavioral phenomena: coital frequency, relational duration, relational concurrency, and coital cessation.     

This model is written in the R programming language.  It requires [EpiModel](http://www.epimodel.org), the epidemic modeling software, to be installed first, as well as [EvoNetHIV](https://github.com/EvoNetHIV).      

Within R:     
`install.packages("EpiModel")`      
`# install devtools if necessary, install.packages("devtools")`     
`devtools::install_github("statnet/EvoNetHIV", ref = "Behavior-JOURNAL-DATE")`
